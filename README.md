# Foodzilla Backend ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leite08/foodzilla-backend.svg?branch=master)

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f311c2159c8141a98c1a042b67823efc)](https://www.codacy.com/app/leite08/foodzilla-backend?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=leite08/foodzilla-backend&utm_campaign=badger)

## Java and String Boot

This application serves the API of Foodzilla, offering endpoints to be called by the frontend.

Depends on [Spoonacular's food information API](https://spoonacular.com), delivered by [Mashape](https://market.mashape.com).
You need to subscribe to Mashape and obtain a key (`X-Mashape-Key`), will need that later before running the application.


Built for the VanHack Week Nov/2017:
http://www.vanhack.com/week/

Basic technologies:

**Java**, Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
 
**Spring Boot**, Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

**Maven**, Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.

## Installation

Install Java 8 JDK:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Install Maven:

	https://maven.apache.org/install.html
	    
Setup the environment variable `foodzillaApiKey` with the key from Mashape, either through (recommended):

	export foodzillaApiKey=<the-value-of-the-key>
	
or during the execution of java, using the `-D<variableName>=<value>` option. 

After forking and cloning the repo:

    cd foodzilla-backend
    mvn install
    cd target/deploy/
    ./start.sh

Will start the application in background with logs on file.

To watch the logs execute this on the deploy folder: `./logs.sh`

There is a Swagger UI available on:

	<install-url>/swagger-ui.html

It can be used to see the API contracts/methods and make calls to the running application.
